# Biography

I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Genetics at Case Western Reserve University. I completed my undergraduate studies at Minzu University of China, where I began as a wet-lab biologist, using experimental approaches to study neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. After graduation, my research interests shifted to 3D genome organization. My current work focuses on studying chromatin architecture and functional insulators (FINs) during early development. Outside of the lab, I enjoy kayaking, swimming, and hiking.
